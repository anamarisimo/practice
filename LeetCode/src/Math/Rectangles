You are given n
 rectangles on a plane with coordinates of their bottom left and upper right points. Some (n−1)
 of the given n
 rectangles have some common point. A point belongs to a rectangle if this point is strictly inside the rectangle or belongs to its boundary.

Find any point with integer coordinates that belongs to at least (n−1)
 given rectangles.
