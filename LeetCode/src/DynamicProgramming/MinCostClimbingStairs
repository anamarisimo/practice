You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase.
Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

Example 1:

Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.

Example 2:

Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.

Constraints:

2 <= cost.length <= 1000
0 <= cost[i] <= 999

--------------------------------------------------

We can make two important observations about this problem.
First, we need to find the maximum or minimum of something. Second, we have to make
decisions that might look different depending on decisions we made previously.
These characteristics are typical of a dynamic programming problem.
In this case, we need to make decisions about either taking 1 step or 2 steps at a time,
and our goal is to minimize the overall cost.
The "top of the floor" does not refer to the final index of costs.
We actually need to "arrive" beyond the array's bounds.
